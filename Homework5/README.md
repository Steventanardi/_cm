# Homework 5 - Geometry Construction

This project implements a system for defining and manipulating geometric shapes (Points, Lines, Circles, and Triangles) and calculating their interactions.

## Features
- **Object Definitions**: Point, Line, Circle, Triangle.
- **Intersections**: 
  - Line vs Line
  - Circle vs Circle
  - Line vs Circle
- **Perpendiculars**: Calculate the foot of a perpendicular from any point to a line.
- **Verification**: Programmatic verification of the Pythagorean theorem.
- **Transformations**: Translation, Scaling, and Rotation for all geometric objects.

## Mathematical Documentation
A detailed explanation of the formulas used (Standard Line Equation, Cramer's Rule, Rotation Matrices) can be found in `explanation.md`.

## Attribution Statement
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Authorship Status**: Original implementation.
> 
> - **Core Logic**: Fully original, optimized for precision using standard geometric algorithms.
> - **AI Usage**: This project was developed with the assistance of an AI (Antigravity). Documentation and comments were generated in English.

## How to Run
Run the main demonstration script:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will perform a series of geometric tests and output the results to the console.
