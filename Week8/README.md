# Week 8 - Probability and Statistics: Mathematical Testing

This project explores the mathematical derivations and manual implementations of standard statistical tests, specifically Z-tests and T-tests.

## Implemented Tests
- **One-Sample Z-Test**: Comparison against a population with known standard deviation.
- **One-Sample T-Test**: Comparison against a population mean with unknown variance.
- **Independent T-Test**: Comparing two distinct, unrelated groups.
- **Paired T-Test**: Comparing related samples (e.g., measurements before and after treatment).

## Documentation
- **Mathematical Derivations**: See `math_principles.md` for the formulas and the rationale behind choosing Z vs T distributions.

## Attribution Statement
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Authorship Status**: Original implementation.
> 
> - **Core Logic**: Manual implementation of statistical formulas to demonstrate the underlying math.
> - **AI Usage**: Developed with AI assistance. Documentation and mathematical explanations were generated in English.

## How to Run
```bash
python statistics_tests.py
```
This script runs sample datasets through the implemented functions and prints the resulting test statistics.
